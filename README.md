## The goal

This project was designed to practice and learn about Object Oriented Programming.

## The game

This game is called **I CAN HAZ CHEEZBURGER?!??**. In the game, you play as an anthropomorphic cheeseburger. The only thing you can do is move left or right with the arrows of your keyboard.

The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible by avoiding the Nyan Cats who are raining from the sky and trying to _haz_ you. The longer you stay alive, the higher your score!

## Notes

To open the project, you need to open `index.html` in the browser/ Go live in VSCode.
