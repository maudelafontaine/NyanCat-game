# Object Oriented Programming Game Project

<!-- <p align="center"><img src="./images/screenshot.png"></p> -->

# Introduction

This project was designed as a way for you to practice and learn about Object Oriented Programming. A good bit of code has already been provided for you, and it makes for an _almost_ working game.

## The game

This game is called **I CAN HAZ CHEEZBURGER?!??**. In the game, you play as an anthropomorphic cheeseburger. The only thing you can do is move left or right with the arrows of your keyboard.

The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible by avoiding the Nyan Cats who are raining from the sky and trying to _haz_ you. The longer you stay alive, the higher your score!

At the moment, the game is a bit broken. This project will have you first fix the broken game, then add your own features to it. :)
